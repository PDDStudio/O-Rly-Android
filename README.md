O-Rly-Android is a simple app which allows you to create O RLY parody covers on your Android phone.


##Disclaimer:

I only created the Android-App for the [O RLY Cover Generator](https://dev.to/rly) and do not hold any special permission, except the agreement to bring this awesome site to Android.


The site is hosted by [@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev) and the original tool was created by [@AModelEngineer](https://twitter.com/AModelEngineer).

##Functions:

- Create O Rly Book Covers with the same functions as on the Website
- Share created Books immediately without saving them on your device
- Save created Books to your device's storage to view and/or use them again
- Android 6.0 Ready

##Notice 
There are a few known edge cases that do not generate.
